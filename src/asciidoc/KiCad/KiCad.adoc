Introduction
------------

KiCad
~~~~~

KiCad is an open-source software tool for the creation of electronic
schematic diagrams and PCB artwork. Beneath its singular surface, kicad
incorporates an elegant ensemble of the following stand-alone software
tools:

* *Kicad* : project manager
* *Eeschema* : schematic editor
* *CvPcb* : footprint selector
* *Pcbnew* : circuit board layout editor
* *GerbView* : Gerber viewer

3 utilities are included

* *Bitmap2Component*: component maker for logos (Creates a schematic
  component or a footprint from a bitmap picture).
* *PcbCalculator*: A calculator that is helpfull to calculate
  components for regulators, track witdth versus current, transmission
  lines...
* *PlEditor*: Page Layout Editor.

At the time of writing, KiCad is considered mature and can be used for
the successful development and maintenance of complex electronic boards.

Kicad does not present any board-size limitation and it can easily
handle up to 16 copper layers and up to 12 technical layers.

Kicad can create all the files necessary for building printed boards:

* Gerber files for photo-plotters
* drilling files
* component location files
* and a lot more.

Being open source (GPL licensed), kicad represents the ideal tool for
projects oriented towards the creation of electronic hardware with an
open-source flavour.

Kicad is available for Linux, Windows and Apple OS X (experimental).

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

Display options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pcbnew needs the support of OpenGL v2.1 or more.

Initialization of the default configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A default configuration file named _kicad.pro_ is supplied in
kicad/template. It serves as a template for any new project.

*The default file _kicad.pro_ can be freely modified if necessary,
mainly to set the list of libraries files loaded by Eeschema or
Pcbnew.*

Some other parameters (default text size, default line thickness, mainly
for Pcbnew) are stored.

Verify you have a write acces to kicad/template/kicad.pro

Run kicad and load _kicad.pro_ project.

Run Eeschema via kicad. Modify and update the Eeschema
configuration, and mainly the list of libraries you want to use each
time you create new projects.

Run Pcbnew via kicad. Modify and update the Pcbnew configuration

Kicad: principles of use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to manage a Kicad project: schematic files, printed circuit
board files, supplementary libraries, manufacturing files for
photo-tracing, drilling and automatic component placement files, it is
recommended to create a project as follows:

* Create a working directory for the project (using KiCad or by other
  means).
* In this directory, use Kicad to create a project file (file with
  extension .pro) via the “Start a new project” icon.

[WARNING]
It is _strongly_ recommended to use the same name for both project file
and its directory.

Kicad creates a file with a .pro extension that maintains a number of
parameters for project management (such as the filename of the principal
schematic, list of libraries used in the schematics and PCBs). Default
names of both principal schematic and printed circuit board files are
derived from the name of the project. Thus, if a project called
_example.pro_ was created in a directory called _example_ , the default
files will be created:

[width="100%",cols="27%,73%",]
|=================================================================
|example.pro |project management file.
|example.sch |main schematic file.
|example. kicad_pcb |printed circuit board file.
|example.net |netlist file.
|example.xxx |various files created by the other utility programs.
|example.cache.lib a|
cache file of libraries used in the schematic

(backup of the components used)

|=================================================================

Use Kicad
---------

Main window
~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/10000000000002B5000001AB64B9B213.png[]

The main KiCad window is composed of a project tree view, a launch pane
containing buttons used to run the various software tools, and a message
window. The menu and the toolbar can be used to create, read and save
project files.

Utility launch pane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kicad allows you to run all stand alone software tools that come with
it.

The launch pane is made of the above 7 buttons that correspond to the
following commands (1 to 7, from left to right):

[width="100%",cols="4%,20%,76%",]
|=======================================================================
|1 |*Eeschema* |The schematic editor
|2 |*Cvpcb* |A tool to create the association between components and the
corresponding footprints
|3 |*Pcbnew* |The board layout editor
|4 |*Gerbview* |A GERBER file viewer. Its also can show drill files.
|5 |*Bitmap2component* |A tool to build a footprint or a component from
a B&W bitmap image to create logos
|6 |*Pcb Calculator* |A tool to calculate track widths, any many other
things
|7 |*Pl Editor* |The Page Layout editor, to create/customize frame
references.
|=======================================================================

Project tree view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image:images/10000000000000C60000009255B0301C.png[]

*   Double-clicking on the Eeschema icons runs the schematic editor which in
    this case will open the file pic_programmer.sch.

*   Double-clicking on the Pcbnew icon runs the layout editor, in this case
    opening the file pic_programmer.kicad_pcb

*   Right clicking on any of the files in the project tree allows generic
    files manipulation.


Top toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~

Using templates
---------------

Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~

A template is a directory of files, which includes a directory of
metadata.

The template system name (SYSNAME) is the directory name under which the
template files are stored. The metadata directory (METADIR) contains
pre-defined files which provide information about the template.

All files and directories in a template are copied to the new project
path when a project is created using a template, except METADIR.

All files and directories which start with SYSNAME will have SYSNAME
replaced by the new project file name, excluding the file extension.

Templates
~~~~~~~~~

They facilitate the easy setup of projects which have common attributes
such as pre-defined board outlines, connector positions, schematic
elements, design rules, etc.

Metadata
^^^^^^^^

A template's METADIR must contain the required files, and might
optionally contain any of the optional files

Required Files:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*meta/info.html*

Contains html formatted information about the template which is used by
the user to determine if the template is what they are after. The
<title> tag determines the actual name of the template that is exposed
to the user for template selection.

Using html to format this document means that images can be in-lined
without having to invent a new scheme.

Only a basic HTML language can be used to format this document.

Optional Files:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*meta/icon.png*

A 64 x 64 pixels PNG icon file which is used as a clickable icon in the
template selection dialog.

Example:
^^^^^^^^

Here is a template for a raspberrypi-gpio board:

image:images/10000000000001BA0000006F670E0EA3.png[]

And the meta data info:

image:images/1000000000000163000000735475F846.png[]

brd.png is an optional file

Here is an info.html file sample:

Operation
^^^^^^^^^

The KiCad File menu New shows 2 option:

image:images/1000000000000185000000F2ADA0CF8E.png[]

- *Blank* *Project* Create a blank project by just copying
  template/kicad.pro to the current folder.
- *Project* __* from Template__* Open the template selection dialog. The
  template selection dialog has a list of icons, and a display window. A
  single click on a template's icon on the left will load that templates
  info.html metadata file and display it in the display window. A click on
  the OK button starts the new project creation. The template will be
  copied to the new project location ( excluding METADIR as mentioned
  earlier ) and any files that match the string replacement rules will be
  renamed to reflect the new project's name.

After selection of a template:

image:images/100000000000028C000002A7A0200039.png[]

Templates Location:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The list of available templates are gathered from the following sources:

- For sytem templates:
  <kicad bin dir>/../share/template/

- For user templates:

  ** on Unix:
     ~/kicad/templates/

  ** on Windows: 
     C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\kicad\templates

  ** on Mac:
     ~/Documents/kicad/templates/

- When the environment variable KICAD_PTEMPLATES is defined, there is a
  third page: Portable Templates, which lists templates found in
  KICAD_PTEMPLATES path.
