General operations
------------------

Toolbars and commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Pcbnew it is possible to executes command via various means:

* text-based menu at the top of the main window.
* top toolbar menu.
* right toolbar menu.
* left toolbar menu.
* mouse buttons (menu options). Specifically:
** The right-hand mouse button reveals a Pop up menu the content of
which depends on the element under the mouse arrow.
* keyboard (Function keys F1, F2, F3, F4, Shift, Delete, +, - Page Up,
Page Down and “space” bar). The “Escape” key generally cancels an
operation in progress.

The screen-shot below illustrates some of the possible accesses to the
operations:

Mouse commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Left button
** Single click displays the characteristics of the module or text under
the cursor to the lower status bar.
** Double click displays the editor (if the element is editable) of the
element under the cursor.
* Centre button/wheel
** Rapid zoom and some commands in layer manager. A 2 button mouse is
undesirable.
** Hold down the centre button and draw a rectangle to zoom to the
described area. The rotation of the mouse wheel will allow you to zoom
in and zoom out.
* Right button
* Displays a pop-up menu

Operations on blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Operations to move, invert (mirror), copy, rotate and delete a block
are all available via the pop-up menu. In addition the view can zoom
to the area described by the block.

The framework of the block is traced by moving the mouse whilst
holding down the left mouse button. The operation is executed when
the button is released.

By holding down one of the hotkeys “Shift” or “Ctrl”, or both keys
“Shift and Ctrl” together, whilst the block is drawn the operation
invert, rotate or delete is automatically selected as shown in the
table below:

[options="header"]
|====
| Action | Effect
| Left mouse button held down
| Trace framework to move block
| Shift + Left mouse button held down
| Trace framework for invert block
| Ctrl + Left mouse button held down
| Trace framework for rotating block 90°
| Shift+Ctrl + Left mouse button held down
| Trace framework to delete the block
| Centre mouse button held down
| Trace framework to zoom to block
|====

When moving a block:

* Move block to new position and operate left mouse button to place
the elements.
* To cancel the operation use the right mouse button
and select Cancel Block from the menu (or press the Esc key).

Alternatively if no key is pressed when drawing the block use the
right mouse button to display the pop-up menu and select the
required operation.

For each block operation a selection window enables the action to be
limited to only some elements.

Selection of grid size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During elements layout the cursor moves on a grid. The grid can be turned on or off using the icon on the left toolbar.

Any of the pre-defined grid sizes, or a User Defined grid, can be
chosen using the pop-up window, or the drop-down selector on the
toolbar at the top of the screen. The size of the User Defined grid
is set using the menu bar option Dimensions -> User Grid Size.

Adjustment of the zoom level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the zoom level:

* Open the pop-up window (using the right mouse button) and to select the desired zoom.
* Or use the function keys:
** `F1`: Enlarge (zoom in)
** `F2`: Reduce (zoom out)
** `F3`: Redraw the display
** `F4`: Centre view at the current cursor position
* Or rotate the mouse wheel.
* Or hold down the middle mouse button and draw a rectangle to zoom to the described area.

Displaying cursor coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cursor coordinates are displayed in inches or millimetres as selected using the 'In' or 'mm' icons on the left hand side toolbar.

Whichever unit is selected Pcbnew always works to a precision of 1/10,000 of inch.

The status bar at the bottom of the screen gives:

* The current zoom setting.
* The absolute position of the cursor.
* The relative position of the cursor. Note the relative coordinates (x,y) can be set to (0,0) at any position by pressing the space bar. The cursor position is then displayed relative to this new datum.

In addition the relative position of the cursor can be displayed using its polar co-ordinates (ray + angle). This can be turned on and off using the icon on the left hand side toolbar.

Keyboard commands - hotkeys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many commands are accessible directly with the keyboard. Selection can be either upper or lower case. Most hot keys are shown in menus. Some hot keys that do not appear are:

* `Delete`: deletes a module or a track. (_Available only if the Module tool or the track tool is active_)
* `V`: if the track tool is active switches working layer or place via, if a track is in progress.
* `+` and `-`: select next or previous layer.
* `?`: display the list off all hot keys.
* `Space`: reset relative coordinates.

Operation on blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operations to move, invert (mirror), copy, rotate and delete a block
are all available from the pop-up menu. In addition the view can
zoom to that described by the block.

The framework of the block is traced by moving the mouse whilst
holding down the left mouse button. The operation is carried out on
releasing the button.

By holding down one of the keys “Shift” or “Ctrl” or both “Shift and
Ctrl” together or “Alt”, whilst the block is drawn the operation
invert, rotate, delete or copy is automatically selected as shown in
the table below:

[options="header"]
|====
| Action | Effect
| Left mouse button held down
| Move block
| Shift + Left mouse button held down
| Invert (mirror) block
| Ctrl + Left mouse button held down
| Rotate block 90°
| Shift+Ctrl + Left mouse button held down
| Delete the block
| Alt + Left mouse button held down
| Copy the block
|====

When a block command is made, a dialog window is displayed, and
items involved in this command can be chosen.

Any of the commands above can be cancelled via the same pop-up menu
or by pressing the Escape key (`Esc`).

Units used in dialogs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Units used to display dimensions values are inch and mm. The desired
unit can be selected by pressing the icon located in left toolbar:
image:images/Inch mm combo icon.png[]
However one can enter the unit used to define a value, when entering
a new value.

Accepted units are:

|====
| 1 *in*  | 1 inch
| 1 *"*   | 1 inch
| 25 *th* | 25 thou
| 25 *mi* | 25 mils, same as thou
| 6 *mm*  | 6 mm
|====

The rules are:

* Spaces between the number and the unit are accepted.
* Only the first two letters are significant.
* In countries using an alternative decimal separator than the period, the period (`.`) can be used as well. Therefore `1,5` and `1.5` are the same in French.
