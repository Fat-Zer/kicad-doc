"CvPcb is a tool that allows you to associate components in your schematic to "

"Typically the net list file generated by Eeschema does not specify which "
"printed circuit board footprint is associated with each component in the "

"be associated during schematic capture by setting the component’s footprint "
"field. CvPcb provides a convenient method of associating footprints to "

"CvPcb is typically invoked from the schematic capture program Eeschema.  "
"Eeschema automatically passes the correct net list file name to CvPcb.  "
"Before running CvPcb for the first time for each project, you must first "
"save the initial net list by selecting the ``Generate Netlist'' entry in to "
"``Tools'' menu or click on the generate net list button on the top tool bar "
"in Eeschema. By default the net list file has the same name as the project "
"with a ``net'' file extension. If the net list file for the project already "
"exists, all footprint associations will be preserved.  After the initial net "
"list file is created by Eeschema, CvPcb can be invoked directly from the "
"KiCad project manager. CvPcb can also be invoked as a stand alone program "
"rather than being launch from the KiCad project manager or the schematic "
"editor. If CvPcb is run as a stand alone program, the net list file must be "
"opened manually by selecting the ``Open'' entry in the ``File'' menu or "
"clicking the ``Open'' file button on the tool bar."
