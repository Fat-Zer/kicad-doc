"The purpose served by the extruded outlines is to give the mechanical "
"designer some idea of the location and physical space occupied by each "
"component. In a typical scenario the mechanical designer will replace some "
"of the crude outlines with more detailed mechanical models, for example when "
"checking to ensure that a right-angle mounted LED will fit into a hole on a "
"panel. In most situations the accuracy of an outline doesn't matter, but it "
"is good practice to create outlines which convey the best mechanical "
"information possible. In a few instances a user may wish to fit the "
"component into a case with very little excess space, for example in a "
"portable music player. In such a situation, if most extruded outlines are a "
"good enough representation of components then the mechanical designer may "
"only have to replace very few models while designing the case. If the "
"outlines are not a reliable reflection of reality then the mechanical "
"designer will waste a lot of time replacing models to ensure a good fit. "
"After all, if you put garbage in you can expect garbage to come out. If you "
"put in good information, you can be confident of good results."
